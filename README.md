🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (SVM)
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset used is the popular Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is widely used in machine learning classification tasks.

📊 Dataset

* The dataset includes several features such as:

* Pregnancies

* Glucose

* Blood Pressure

* Skin Thickness

* Insulin

* BMI

* Diabetes Pedigree Function

* Age

* Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

🧪 Technologies Used

* Python 

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Scikit-learn

* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

* Jupyter Notebook

* Git & GitHub

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-svm.git
cd diabetes-prediction-svm

📈 Results
* The SVM classifier was able to predict diabetes with a good level of accuracy 79.72 %.
